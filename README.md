# The Making and Knowing Project *Sandbox*

[https://cu-mkp.github.io/sandbox/](https://cu-mkp.github.io/sandbox/)

The “Sandbox” space makes available a number of resources that utilize and explore the data underlying [_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France. A Digital Critical Edition and English Translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/) created by the [Making and Knowing Project](https://www.makingandknowing.org/) (M&K) at Columbia University.

The Sandbox presents experimental, provisional, and in-progress work that expands upon the engagement and analyses with the data, topics, content, and methodologies of _Secrets of Craft and Nature_ and with the manuscript, BnF Ms. Fr. 640. 

Related repositories:
- [cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data) for XML transcriptions and translation of Fr. 640, as well as metadata and derivative files
- [cu-mkp/manuscript-object](https://github.com/cu-mkp/manuscript-object) for data extraction, manipulation, transformation, and analysis

The Making and Knowing Project hopes to create an online environment for students, scholars, and others to explore and experiment with the Project’s data using a variety of digital tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks), where others can add and create their own tools, case studies, and resources presented here. Projects include visualizations and analysis of Fr. 640 through NLP, explorations of M&K's encoding oteaching resources such as assignment sheets
