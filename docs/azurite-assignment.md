## Pigments and Paints
 
It is important to remember that there is a difference between pigments and paints. A pigment is an insoluble colored particle; in other words, it is usually a dry powder of a certain color that will not dissolve when added to a desired medium or liquid. To create paint, one combines the pigment with a binding medium to create a paste that can be applied to a surface. A binding medium will help the pigment adhere to the surface on which it is applied. Common binding media include linseed and walnut oils (for oil painting), gum arabic (watercolor and ink), egg yolk (tempera), egg white (glair), and animal glues (distemper). For more information:

## Azurite

Refer to [Presentation: Preparing and Painting Blue Pigment in the Renaissance](fa22_skillbuilding-azurite-presentation-full.pdf) for full information. See also a [short version of this presentation](fa22_skillbuilding-azurite-presentation-short.pdf).

Azurite is a basic copper carbonate pigment \[2CuCO3-Cu(OH)2\], a common blue colorant found in paintings, drawings, and illuminated manuscripts of the Renaissance. It is found as a natural ore, often co-occuring with the green mineral malachite which is also a copper carbonate pigment. To prepare the pigment, the mineral is ground to a powder, removing any malachite or other impurities. Larger particles of azurite are a deeper blue and as the particles are more finely ground, it becomes paler in color. The different hues can be separated into different "grades": larger particles (dark blue) are a higher grade of pigment than smaller particles (pale blue). These different grades can be obtained through a process known as levigation, where water is used to separate the smaller, duller particles from the larger ones which sink to the bottom. The smaller (and thus less heavy) particles float closer to the top of the water, which is poured off successively until only heaviest, deepest blue particles remain.

### Other Blue Pigments

Azurite is only one of the most common blue pigments in the Renassaince palette. Other pigments include the very costly lapis lazuli (also known as ultramarine), the cobalt blue glass smalt, and the organic indigo. A "synthetic" blue copper carbonate blue, known both as bice and verditer, has the same chemical makeup as azurite but is made by an artisan rather than sourced as a natural ore (for example, by combining copper nitrate and calcium carbonate).
