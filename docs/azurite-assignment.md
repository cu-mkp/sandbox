## Introduction

This skillbuilding assignment will introduce you to one of the most common blue pigments in the Renaissance, azurite. You will learn about what azurite is and how it is used in works of art. Following sixteenth-century instructions, you will prepare azurite as a pigment from the mineral ore by purifying it, and then use the pigment to create paint.

## Pigments and Paints
 
It is important to remember that there is a difference between pigments and paints. A pigment is an insoluble colored particle; in other words, it is usually a dry powder of a certain color that will not dissolve when added to a desired medium or liquid. To create paint, one combines the pigment with a binding medium to create a paste that can be applied to a surface. A binding medium will help the pigment adhere to the surface on which it is applied. Common binding media include linseed and walnut oils (for oil painting), gum arabic (watercolor and ink), egg yolk (tempera), egg white (glair), and animal glues (distemper). For more information:

## Azurite

Azurite is a basic copper carbonate pigment \[2CuCO3-Cu(OH)2\], a common blue colorant found in paintings, drawings, and illuminated manuscripts of the Renaissance. It is found as a natural ore, often co-occuring with the green mineral malachite which is also a copper carbonate pigment. To prepare the pigment, the mineral is ground to a powder, removing any malachite or other impurities. Larger particles of azurite are a deeper blue and as the particles are more finely ground, it becomes paler in color. The different hues can be separated into different "grades": larger particles (dark blue) are a higher grade of pigment than smaller particles (pale blue). These different grades can be obtained through a process known as levigation, where water is used to separate the smaller, duller particles from the larger ones which sink to the bottom. The smaller (and thus less heavy) particles float closer to the top of the water, which is poured off successively until only heaviest, deepest blue particles remain.

### Other Blue Pigments

Azurite is only one of the most common blue pigments in the Renassaince palette. Other pigments include the very costly lapis lazuli (also known as ultramarine), the cobalt blue glass smalt, and the organic indigo. A "synthetic" blue copper carbonate blue, known both as bice and verditer, has the same chemical makeup as azurite but is made by an artisan rather than sourced as a natural ore (for example, by combining copper nitrate and calcium carbonate).

 ## Blue Pigments in BnF Ms. Fr. 640
 
There are a few notes on various blue pigments in BnF Ms. Fr. 640 (the sixteenth-century artisanal/technical manual studied by the Making and Knowing Project). It is not always clear which blue pigment the author-practitioner is referring to in the processes he describes. Many of the instructions or observations can be interpretated in more than one way. We encourage you to explore the instances of "blue" in the manuscript by:
- Searching the digital critical edition of Fr. 640, [*Secrets of Craft and Nature*](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/), for "azur" - try a wildcard search by entering "\*azur\*" to catch all variations of the word (enter asterisks on either side of the word as shown here).

## Folio 11r: "Painting *esmail d’azur* in oil"

On [folio 11r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/11r/f/11r/tl) of Ms. Fr. 640, there is an entry that describes a way to prepare a blue pigment called *esmail d'azur*. It is unclear exactly which blue pigment it refers to, and the processes described could be applied to the preparation of smalt, azurite, something else...?

 > This is a secret that is hardly known to common painters. Some take the most delicate they can & grind it with ceruse, which binds it, and next prick with an awl in several places the area they want to paint with *azur d’esmail*, in order that the oil enters & leaks in, & does not cause the azure, which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the panel flat & put down the azure on it, which is also done in distemper. The main thing is to grind it well on marble, and before that, to have washed it thoroughly. Some grind it <del>with</del> thoroughly with an egg yolk & then wash it in five or six waters and lay it on not with a paintbrush, which would be too soft, but with a brush thoroughly softened & crimped, & layering it thickly as if one were putting it down with a trowel; settling down it evens out and flattens. I have experienced that grinding *azur d’esmail* with egg yolk & next washing it in several waters is good. However, it loses a little of its vividness in the grinding of it. I have also washed it in several waters &, when it had settled a little, I removed the water, still <del>q</del> blue, with a sponge and squeezed it into another vessel <del>thus</del> where it settled, & from the residue I had the ash, flower, and subtlest part of the azure without grinding it, which is the best, for in the grinding of it, it loses some of its tint. Those who make it in Germany compound it like enamel, in large pieces which they pestle, & pass through several sieves & wash.<br/>
> To make azures beautiful, they wash or soak them in a rock water, as they call it; it is a water distilled from mines where azure or vert d’azur is found, which distills naturally through the veins of the mountain or is distilled through an alembic <del>*par*</del> from mineral stones of azure or copper.<br/>
> Azure ashes are only good for landscapes because they die in oil. Only true azure holds on. Azur d’esmail cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it, therefore, on the fingernail or the oil palette. If it <del>[*illegible*]<del> happens to be sandy, do not grind it except with the egg yolk or, better yet, wash it in clear water & with a sponge remove the colored water after it starts to go to the bottom, and in this manner you will extract the very delicate flower, which will be easy to work with.
