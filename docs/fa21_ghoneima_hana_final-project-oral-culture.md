# Oral Culture in Ms. Fr. 640

Hana Ghoneima

Making and Knowing Project, Fall 2021

BnF Ms. Fr. 640 stands at the intersection of a pivotal moment in
history, in which craftspeople who were previously illiterate began
recording their procedures and trade in writing.[1] Within this context,
Ms. Fr. 640 is an illuminating document not only for its content on
craft techniques, but for the historical milestones and trends it
embodies. One of those is oral culture, and its intersection with the
written one. Oral culture is defined as a form of communication in which
knowledge is transmitted orally from one person to another. According to
the historian Jan Vansina, within oral culture "there must be
transmission by word of mouth over at least a generation."[2]
Importantly, oral culture can be interpreted as “Any situation in which
people speak generates messages, some of which may be repeated and hence
start a process of transmission,” and it includes both the process of
oral transmission itself as well as its products.[3] Similarly, oral
culture can also be thought of as “a reconstruction of the past from
oral sources…which will throw light on the particular aspect of social
life under study.”[4] As such, oral culture is understood as the shared
transmission of vernacular experience, and is an important tool for the
study of historical eras in which masses were largely illiterate and
access to written work limited.

Despite the seeming contrast between oral and written sources, there is
significant scholarly interest in the importance of handwritten and
printed knowledge within oral culture. In fact, oral culture cannot be
evaluated independently of written tradition, and the intersection of
the two sheds light on topics such as authenticity and representation.
According to Susan Stewart, “when oral forms are transformed into
‘evidence’ and ‘artefacts,’ they acquire all the characteristics of
fragmentation, symbolic meaning, and literariness that are most valued
by the literary culture.”[5] In this light, studying the written
material of BnF Ms. Fr. 640 is an important tool for understanding the
oral transmission of craft knowledge and production techniques passed
over generations.

As such, the purpose of this project is to locate traces of oral culture
that are dispersed throughout Ms. Fr. 640. For the purpose of this
project, oral culture was defined as any instance in which the
author-practitioner referenced or implied that the knowledge he is
writing of has been acquired from another person or place via hearing or
something that is said. An example of this is in fol.
[<u>36v</u>](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/36v/f/36v/tl):
“One says that in Lorraine & in Flanders well-made glass is made of fern
ashes & pebbles…” Distinct here is his specific reference to having
acquired this knowledge through other people’s talk. This is in contrast
to instances in which he cites books or references written knowledge,
such as in fol.
[<u>162r</u>](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/162r/f/162r/tl),
in which he explains information about the Phoenecians acquired from
Herodotus’ *Clio*. Below, I will lay out the methodology and results of
different approaches I took to evaluating this issue.

## References to “Say” and “Said”

Using the search functionality of Oxygen XML Editor, I compiled lists of
all the times the author-practitioner used the words “say,” “said,”
“hear,” or “heard” throughout the [<u>English translation of the Ms. Fr.
640</u>](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/tree/master/ms-xml/tl).
Then, I manually went through each entry on the list and
cross-referenced them with their locations in the manuscript to check
for instances where the author-practitioner is specifically referencing
knowledge that is said/heard by another person. For example, on fol.
[<u>21v</u>](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/21v/f/21v/tl),
he writes that “Some say that one should remove…” and in fol.
[<u>43v</u>](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/43v/f/43v/tl)
he writes that “It is said that pulverized talc…” These instances show
direct examples where the author-practitioner is writing down things
that he heard from elsewhere, including facts, techniques, and opinions
of others. With the word “say,” of the 103 total times the word was
used, 32% (n=33) specifically reference something that another person
said and that the author-practitioner is now recording (*Fig. 1*). The
word “said” was used 198 times, of which 8.6% (n=17) specifically
reference something which another person said (*Fig. 2*). However, there
were no instances of this with the words “hear” and “heard.”

## Orally Transmitted Knowledge Across Professions and Places

To investigate the presence of oral culture through a different lens, I
went through the profession (“pro”) and place (“pl”) tags within Ms. Fr.
640. These editorial tags are encoded within the digital manuscript to
describe certain words, phrases, and features of the text.[6] The “pro”
tag denotes instances where the author-practitioner references another
recognized trade, such as a painter, while the “pl” tag highlights
specific places that are mentioned in the text, such as France. In my
initial search within the manuscript, I found that there were several
instances where the author-practitioner references things he has heard
or is aware that another profession or people from another place do. For
example, in fol.
[<u>29v</u>](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29v/f/29v/tl),
he says: “Apothecaries say that anything which does not adhere to …”
denoting that he is writing down something which he heard from
apothecaries, while in fol.
[<u>136v</u>](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/136v/f/136v/tl)
he explains that “Some say that German tokens are …” As such, using
Oxygen, I compiled a list of all the “pro” and “pl” tags within the
manuscript. This resulted in a list of 366 “pro” tags and 266 “pl” tags.
I manually went through each tag and sorted the list of results
according to whether the author was actually referencing the way
something is done or just casually referring to a place/profession. For
example, a 'yes' would be the author-practitioner’s description of how
glass is made in France while a 'no' would be Venice turpentine, which
is not actually referencing the place but is the given name of the
material. Below are the initial graphs showing percentages of the number
of tags actually referencing another place or profession in the context
of how something is done versus tags that are not. Within the profession
tag, 50.1% (n=183) specifically reference transmittable knowledge
regarding the way another profession does something, while 49.9% (n=182)
do not (*Fig. 3*). Within the place tag, 27.8% (n=74) referenced the
author-practitioner's knowledge regarding the way something is done in
another location, while 72.2% (n=192) do not. Entries labeled ‘no’ are
usually general discussions of the profession/place or other
miscellaneous uses (*Fig. 4*).

*Fig 3*. Percentage of entries tagged with “pro” which show evidence of
oral transmission of knowledge (‘*yes’*) versus those which do not
(‘*no’*).

*Fig 4*. Percentage of entries tagged with “pl” which show evidence of
oral transmission of knowledge (‘*yes’*) versus those which do not
(‘*no’*).

These results give an initial look at the presence of oral culture
within the manuscript. Within these tags, the author-practitioner
mentions techniques and recipes done in other places or by other
professions. Often, he specifically includes that he heard this
information, making it clear that it’s orally transmitted, while other
times he is more ambiguous about where he acquired the information from.
As such, one limitation of this textual analysis is that contextual
examination of the surrounding text has to be done to best interpret the
author-practitioner's meaning and determine the source of the
information he is writing of. Nevertheless, in all of these instances,
he is describing a technique done by another profession or place and
physically recording this information into a literary form, and thus
contributing to the trend of transcribing the practices of his field
that have scarcely been recorded before. Further, none of the instances
where he is less explicit about hearing the information include a
citation or reference to another text or written work, making it likely
that he is transcribing knowledge that he acquired not from another text
but rather through the transmission of knowledge via oral methods or
experience.[7]

Within the tags that were categorized as ‘yes’ for indicating a specific
reference to how something is done in another place or profession, I
broke down the categories according to the specific place/profession
mentioned (*Fig. 5-6*).

## *Women and Peasants Within the Oral Culture of Ms. Fr. 640*

Oral culture was heavily propagated by women and lower-class members of
society. In fact, at the time of the manuscript, books and other written
documents were still largely connected to the upper and elite classes.
As such, women and peasants, many of whom were illiterate, relied on
transmission of knowledge through vernacular modes.[8] At the same time,
these groups of people were also highly involved in the handiwork of the
time. For example, fields were predominantly worked by the lower
classes, and French peasants were hired by merchants to process
harvested grains for importation to urban artisans.[9] As such, it is
likely that peasants held wide-ranging knowledge about various skills
and practices, many of which would have been transferred through
experience and word of mouth. Yet, in Ms. Fr. 640, there are only two
explicit references to techniques employed by peasants. On fol.
[<u>67r</u>](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/67r/f/67r/tl),
the author-practitioner mentions that peasants used taffeta to make
banners, while on fol.
[<u>121v</u>](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/121v/f/121v/tl)
he mentions the type of bowls which peasants eat their soup from.

Similarly, women were highly involved in many of the practices described
in Ms. Fr. 640, including gardening and food storage and preparation,
meaning they were also very knowledgeable in the cultivation and uses of
a variety of plants.[10] Women were also commonly responsible for the
creation of medicine, and many of these recipes were collected by the
women and traded via networks of oral transmission.[11] Yet, despite
this, women have very little presence within Ms. Fr. 640, and none of
the medicinal recipes included are linked to women. In fact, of the
seven mentions of women in the manuscript, only brief references are
included to techniques or recipes employed by them. On fol.
[<u>58r</u>](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl),
the author-practitioner mentions that “ladies, wanting to color their
cheeks, grind Florence lake very finely, then fill a little cotton with
it, which they next wrap in a little fabric of Cambray which is clear.
And thus they pounce the lake on their cheeks & then, with another clean
cotton, they soften it.” On fol.
[<u>113v</u>](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/113v/f/113v/tl),
we get a reference that women make starch water, giving us subtle
insights into their working lives. Albeit brief, the references to
peasants and women serve the dual purpose of confirming the presence of
both groups in the production processes of the time, while also
highlighting the way in which they were frequently overlooked in the
written traditions that were emerging.

## Conclusion

Although the author-practitioner does not often describe where he
acquired his recipes from, he offers wide-ranging clues to the
importance of oral culture to the acquisition of the knowledge he
describes. For example, many of the medicinal recipes he recounts
include a place of origin. Given that it’s highly unlikely that the
author-practitioner visited those places, it is probable that he
acquired this information orally from others, such as artisans or
travelers.[12] Sometimes, he is more explicit about how he came about
his knowledge, and he often states that he learned of a technique or
recipe from a place or a specific profession.[13] For example, when
describing a salve for burns in fol.
[<u>103r</u>](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/102v/f/103r/tl),
he details that “A gunpowder maker who had almost completely burnt
himself & showed no sign of the burn, taught me this,” further
suggesting that the efficacy of this recipe is tied to the vernacular
mode and first-hand nature of its acquisition. This method of knowledge
gathering is a pattern frequently found throughout the manuscript, and
in this way, Ms. Fr. 640 elucidates the ways in which the advent of
written texts and recorded recipes made long term changes within the
field of artisanal craftsmanship, which had traditionally been passed
down through word of mouth and in apprenticeships. The significance of
this synergy of the oral with the written is that it is
self-perpetuating: the author-practitioner records his knowledge of
recipes and then builds upon them with his own experience and
experimentation. These documents can then spread to others, who can
relate their own experiences to the new written frameworks of
craftsmanship and contribute to the further sustenance of the knowledge.
Interestingly, while the manuscript provides insight into this oral
transmission of recipes, it also serves another function by highlighting
gaps in the records of its history, such as the role of women and
peasants in the transmission of said recipes.

All in all, the folios contained within Ms. Fr. 640 possess immense
value in being the manifestations of real-time circulation of artisanal
knowledge and technique. This spread of knowledge, as facilitated by
print culture, not only exchanged with older forms of oral traditions,
but brought these traditions to the forefront, ushering in a new era for
the exchange and recording of work.
