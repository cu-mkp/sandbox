# Understanding and Analyzing the Categories of the Entries in BnF Ms. Fr. 640

The anonymous, 16th-century artisanal manuscript, BnF Ms. Fr. 640, is comprised of almost 1,000 "entries." In the Making and Knowing Project's [_Secrets of Craft and Nature
in Renaissance France. A Digital Critical Edition and English Translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/), an entry is a unit of text under a title. These include instructions, recipes, descriptions, and observations on a wide range of topics, including casting, painting, and medicine. 

Each entry has been grouped into at least one (and up to three) descriptive categories. These are attributes of each entry `<div>`, and can be extracted from the xml of the manuscript pages.
> For example, `<div id="p004v_1" categories="varnish;arms and armor">` for the entry on fol. 4v, "Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, &c"

## Percentage of Entries by Category
As can be seen by the bar graph below, "casting" by far has the most entries of any category, followed by "painting" and then "metal process."

### Raw Data and Generation

This plot is generated by [manuscript_visualizations.py](https://github.com/cu-mkp/manuscript-object/blob/v1.0-ronikaufman/manuscript_visualizations.py) developed by [Roni Kaufman](https://github.com/ronikaufman) in summer 2020 using underlying workflows in [cu-mkp/manuscript-object](https://github.com/cu-mkp/manuscript-object).

The raw data (the xml-encoded transcriptions and translations of the manuscript text) is found in [cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/ms-xml](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/tree/master/ms-xml). See also the extracted elements and properties in [cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/metadata/entry-metadata.csv](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/blob/master/metadata/entry_metadata.csv).

### Why is This Interesting?

- **Casting:** A large majority of casting recipes supports the theory that this is the author-practitioner's main focus and area of expertise. The casting entries are some of the longest and seen to contain the most first-hand observations and active experimentation.
     - From fol. 80v to 93r is an almost uninterrupted cluster of entries discussing the author-practitioner's first-hand experiments with sands and other molding materials for casting.
     - For example, see [fol. 84v-85r, "Sand for lead, the most excellent of all, for high and low reliefs"](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl), in which he records multiple trials, failures, and successes. The best method? Mix ceruse (lead carbonate) with egg white into the sand and oil the mold lightly with walnut oil.
     - Interested in failure? Check out this video of Project Postdoc Tianna Uchacz discussing this further:
     [![Recipes for Failure: Experimenting, Repairing, and Quitting in Renaissance Toulouse](../images/uchacz-failure.png?raw=true)](https://vimeo.com/487139383 "Recipes for Failure: Experimenting, Repairing, and Quitting in Renaissance Toulouse")
- **Alchemy:** While the manuscript was originally thought to contain alchemical writings, as was common for many "Books of Secrets" in the Renaissance that contained first-hand experimentation, the distribution of categories shows that "alchemy" is one of the least prevalent categories. In fact, there is only one entry that is "alchemical": [fol. 52r, "The work done in Algiers"](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/52r/f/52r/tl)

## Distribution of Entry Categories Across the Folios

The manuscript is composed of 170 folios which is 340 pages:

1 folio = front page and back page

The first folio is 1r (recto = front) and 1v (verso = back), the second is 2r and 2v, then 3r, 3v, etc.

Starting at the beginning of the manuscript on 1r and ending with the last page, 170v, each entry is plotted below by category. This shows us the distribution of the entry categories across the entire manuscript.

One black vertical line = 1 entry.

### Why is This Interesting?

**Casting and Painting Clusters: Is the Author-Practitioner a Metalworker?**
- **Casting**, the largest category, is found throughout the entire manuscript, but clustering of entries can be seen in the second half, especially around the 90s and after fol. 115r or so.
- Good molds rely on good sands (or earths), according to the author-practitioner. Like modern-day plaster, these sands (often mixed with a liquid binder) form the hollow mold into which molten metal, wax, or sulfur can be poured to create a cast object.
- He recommends a number of additivies to the sands, including:
     - [Fol. 15r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15r/f/15r/tl): "horse dung & cloth waste"
     - [Fol. 41r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/41r/f/41r/tl): "brick thoroughly ground on marble, or plaster or calcined alabaster"
     - [Fol. 68r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/68r/f/68r/tl): "chalk, pestled glass, tripoli & burnt linen"
     - [Fol. 127r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/127r/f/127r/tl): "crocum, iron scales, loops of iron, emery"
- **Painting** entries appear earlier in the manuscript, with a distinct cluster of entries around the 60s. This seems to start with [fol. 56v, "Painter,"](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl) a relatively long entry which covers a wide variety of topics:
     - pigments: "Vermilion ground by itself is wan and pale"
     - binding media: "In distemper do not mix your different colors together"
     - tools: "For palettes to paint, ivory is excellent"
     - geographical practices: "The Italians soften by hatching with a large flattened paintbrush"
- There is a section which appears in the continuation of this entry on fol. 57r that may provide further evidence that the author-practitioner's main focus, or perhaps his main area of expertise, is casting. Even in an entry about various painting techniques and materials, he draws immediate connection back to casting (bold has been added for emphasis and does not appear in the original):
     > "...Lake takes long to dry in oil and for that reason one must **grind some glass** with it. But one needs to choose cristallin because it is cleaner. And because it would be too difficult to grind by itself, one must redden it on the fire, then when entirely red throw it into cold water, & it will crumble & pulverize easily for grinding it afterward. Being well ground it with a lot of water, **it resembles ground lead white**, but for all this it has no body. **I think it would be good for casting**."
- The clustering of painting entries also corresponds to a section with very few casting entries. Perhaps this is a general trend? 

\[IN PROGRESS -- NOTES BELOW\]

**Use of a Scribe?**
- While the great majority of the manuscript is written in one hand, there are a few instances of a different hand, including a number of sequential entries that begin on [fol. 73r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/73r/f/73r/tl) and end on [fol. 76v](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/76v/f/76v/tl). The writing here is a semi-calligraphic French script and is most likely that of a scribe. The same hand appears again in a series of entries from [fol. 57r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl) to [fol. 58r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl) and from [fol. 77r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl) to [fol. 79v]](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl).
