# Understanding and Analyzing the Categories of the Entries in BnF Ms. Fr. 640

The anonymous, 16th-century artisanal manuscript, BnF Ms. Fr. 640, is comprised of almost 1,000 "entries." In the Making and Knowing Project's [_Secrets of Craft and Nature
in Renaissance France. A Digital Critical Edition and English Translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/), an entry is a unit of text under a title. These include instructions, recipes, descriptions, and observations on a wide range of topics, including casting, painting, and medicine. 

Each entry has been grouped into at least one (and up to three) descriptive categories. These are attributes of each entry `<div>`, and can be extracted from the xml of the manuscript pages.
> For example, `<div id="p004v_1" categories="varnish;arms and armor">` for the entry on fol. 4v, "Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, &c"

## Percentage of Entries by Category
As can be seen by the bar graph below, "casting" by far has the most entries of any category, followed by "painting" and then "metal process."

### Raw Data and Generation

This plot is generated by [manuscript_visualizations.py](https://github.com/cu-mkp/manuscript-object/blob/v1.0-ronikaufman/manuscript_visualizations.py) developed by [Roni Kaufman](https://github.com/ronikaufman) in summer 2020 using underlying workflows in [cu-mkp/manuscript-object](https://github.com/cu-mkp/manuscript-object).

The raw data (the xml-encoded transcriptions and translations of the manuscript text) is found in [cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/ms-xml](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/tree/master/ms-xml). See also the extracted elements and properties in [cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/metadata/entry-metadata.csv](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/blob/master/metadata/entry_metadata.csv).

### Why is This Interesting?

- **Casting:** A large majority of casting recipes supports the theory that this is the author-practitioner's main focus and area of expertise. The casting entries are some of the longest and seen to contain the most first-hand observations and active experimentation.
     - From fol. 80v to 93r is an almost uninterrupted cluster of entries discussing the author-practitioner's first-hand experiments with sands and other molding materials for casting.
     - For example, see [fol. 84v-85r, "Sand for lead, the most excellent of all, for high and low reliefs"](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/84v/f/84v/tl), in which he records multiple trials, failures, and successes. The best method? Mix ceruse (lead carbonate) with egg white into the sand and oil the mold lightly with walnut oil.

- **Alchemy:** While the manuscript was originally thought to contain alchemical writings, as was common for many "Books of Secrets" in the Renaissance that contained first-hand experimentation, the distribution of categories shows that "alchemy" is one of the least prevalent categories. In fact, there is only one entry that is "alchemical": [fol. 52r, "The work done in Algiers"](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/52r/f/52r/tl)

## Distribution of Entry Categories Across the Folios

The manuscript is composed of 170 folios which is 340 pages:

1 folio = front page and back page

The first folio is 1r (recto = front) and 1v (verso = back), the second is 2r and 2v, then 3r, 3v, etc.

Starting at the beginning of the manuscript on 1r and ending with the last page, 170v, each entry is plotted below by category. This shows us the distribution of the entry categories across the entire manuscript.

One black vertical line = 1 entry.

### Why is This Interesting?

**Casting and Painting Clusters: Is the Author-Practitioner a Metalworker?**
- **Casting**, the largest category, is found throughout the entire manuscript, but clustering of entries can be seen in the second half, especially around the 90s and after fol. 115r or so.
- Good molds rely on good sands (or earths), according to the author-practitioner. Like modern-day plaster, these sands (often mixed with a liquid binder) form the hollow mold into which molten metal, wax, or sulfur can be poured to create a cast object.
- He recommends a number of additivies to the sands, including:
     - [Fol. 15r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/15r/f/15r/tl): "horse dung & cloth waste"
     - [Fol. 41r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/41r/f/41r/tl): "brick thoroughly ground on marble, or plaster or calcined alabaster"
     - [Fol. 68r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/68r/f/68r/tl): "chalk, pestled glass, tripoli & burnt linen"
     - [Fol. 127r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/127r/f/127r/tl): "crocum, iron scales, loops of iron, emery"
- **Painting** entries appear earlier in the manuscript, with a distinct cluster of entries around the 60s. This seems to start with [fol. 56v, "Painter,"](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl) a relatively long entry which covers a wide variety of topics:
     - pigments: "Vermilion ground by itself is wan and pale"
     - binding media: "In distemper do not mix your different colors together"
     - tools: "For palettes to paint, ivory is excellent"
     - geographical practices: "The Italians soften by hatching with a large flattened paintbrush"
- There is a section which appears in the continuation of this entry on fol. 57r that may provide further evidence that the author-practitioner's main focus, or perhaps his main area of expertise, is casting. Even in an entry about various painting techniques and materials, he draws immediate connection back to casting (bold has been added for emphasis and does not appear in the original):
     > "...Lake takes long to dry in oil and for that reason one must **grind some glass** with it. But one needs to choose cristallin because it is cleaner. And because it would be too difficult to grind by itself, one must redden it on the fire, then when entirely red throw it into cold water, & it will crumble & pulverize easily for grinding it afterward. Being well ground it with a lot of water, **it resembles ground lead white**, but for all this it has no body. **I think it would be good for casting**."
- The clustering of painting entries also corresponds to a section with very few casting entries. Perhaps this is a general trend? 

## Use of a Scribe?

While the great majority of the manuscript is written in one hand, there are a few instances of a different hand, including a number of sequential entries that begin on [fol. 73r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/73r/f/73r/tl) and end on [fol. 76v](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/76v/f/76v/tl). The writing here is a semi-calligraphic French script and is most likely that of a scribe. The same hand appears again in a series of entries from [fol. 57r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl) to [fol. 58r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl) and from [fol. 77r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl) to [fol. 79v](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl).

The sections are highlighted below in red.

**Categories of the Scribe's Entries**

These sections show that the author-practitioner may have employed a scribe to assist him in the gathering and recording of entries.
The types of entries written by the scribe all fall within the same few categories, highlighted below in blue.
![categories-swarmplot-scribe-categories](../images/entry-swarmplot-scribe-categories.png?raw=true)

The categories by section:
- [fol. 57r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/57r/f/57r/tl) to [fol. 58r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/58r/f/58r/tl) are all categorized as "painting," "varnish," and "arms and armor"
     
| Category       | # entries |
|----------------|-----------|
| painting       | 2         |
| varnish        | 1         |
| arms and armor | 1         |

- [fol. 73r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/73r/f/73r/tl) to [fol. 76v](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/76v/f/76v/tl) are "wood and its coloring," "metal process," "wax processes," and "varnish"
   
| Category                | # entries |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| wood and its coloring   | 22        |
| metal process           | 9         |
| varnish                 | 5         |
| wax process             | 3         |
| painting                | 2         |
| corrosives              | 1         |

- [fol. 77r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77r/f/77r/tl) to [fol. 79v](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl) are "wood and its coloring," "varnish," "metal process," and "medicine" 

| Category                | # entries |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| wood and its coloring   | 6         |
| varnish                 | 8         |
| metal process           | 3         |
| medicine                | 1         |

- One category that seems to dominate is "wood and its coloring." Of the 32 entries in this category, 28 are written by the scribe - that's 87.5% of the category! Thus, the author-practitioner only wrote 4 of the entries treating this topic.
- Notably, there are no entries categorized as "casting," the author-practitioner's main concern throughout the manuscript.

**Evidence of the Scribe's Work**

What clues in the text do we see to support the theory that the author-practitioner was working together with a scribe?

- One example is an intervention on [fol. 73r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/73r/f/73r/tl). In the entry, *moullée* (grindings) is added in a hand that is most likely the author-practitioner's, to fill in a blank left by the scribe who wrote the rest of the page.
![73r_facsimile_scribe-annotated](../images/73r_fac_scribe-ann.png?raw=true)
- There is also evidence of dictation: perhaps the author-practitioner spoke out loud to the scribe who wrote his notes down. In multiple entries on fols. [77v](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/77v/f/77v/tl), [78r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/78r/f/78r/tl), and [79v](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/79v/f/79v/tl), the scribe seems to have been confused by the word "sandarac," a type of resin used commonly in varnish recipes. He writes down words that sound similar, such as *sang* (blood) *de Drac* (of the dragon) or *da Rac* (the devil's shout), before ultimately correcting them.
![79v_facsimile_scribe-annotated](../images/79v_fac_scribe-ann.png?raw=true)
- In a longer entry that begins on [fol. 56v](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/56v/f/56v/tl), "Painter," the author-practitioner composes most of the entry, but a few sections in the middle are written by the scribe. Perhaps they were taking turns writing things down? Or writing at different times, adding to each other's sections?
![57r-scribe-annotated](../images/57r-scribe-annotated.png?raw=true)

## Painting and Varnish Entries

We often closely associate varnish recipes with painting recipes in the Renaissance. For example, in Cennino Cennini's _The Craftsman’s Handbook, ‘Il Libro dell’Arte’_, trans. by Daniel Thompson (New York: Dover, 1960), notes of varnish follow the sections on painting.

**Cennini's Painting Sections**
- "_II: The second section of this book: brining you to the working up of the colors_"
- "_III: The method and system for working on a wall, that is, in fresco_"
- "_IV: How to paint in oil on a wall, on panel, on iron, and where you please_"
- "_V: The system by which you should prepare to acquire the skill to work on panel_"
- "_VI: How you should start to work on panel or anconas_"

**Cennini's Varnish Section**
- "_Introduction to a short section on varnishing_"
- "_When to varnish_"
- "_How to apply varnish_"
- "_How to make a painting look as if it were varnished_"

Varnishing was often the final step in the creation of the painting, covering the layers of (usually) oil paint with a layer of varnish to help protect the paint underneath or to enhance the optical effect of the painting. Many painting treatises of this period include recipes for varnishes alongside pigment recipes and descriptions of painting techniques.  

Cennini even notes that when you varnish your colors or paintings, 
> "they then become very fresh and beautiful, and remain in pristine state forever." 

In BnF Ms. Fr. 640, there are 189 entries categorized as "painting," "varnish," or both "painting" and "varnish."
