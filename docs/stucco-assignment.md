## Ephemeral Art in BnF Ms. Fr. 640
The 16th-century artisanal/technical manual, BnF Ms. Fr. 640, contains hundreds of entries that describe making processes and techniques from the Renaissance. These include instructions for and observations about painting, gilding, arms and armor production, plant cultivation, and making molds and metal casts.

Among other topics, the manuscript offers insight into the cultural context, materials, and techniques of ephemeral artworks. Several entries in the manuscript aim to produce artworks that were intended to stand outside or that aimed to create the visual effect of a more permanent (and expensive) work of art. 
Explore the full range of topics in Ms. Fr. 640 in [_Secrets of Craft and Nature. A Digital Critical Edition of BnF Ms. Fr. 640_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/).

## Stucco for Molding
On [folio 29r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/29r/f/29r/tl), an entry describes a process for making stucco to create "an ornament at little expense."
