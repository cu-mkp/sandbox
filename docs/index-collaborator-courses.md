Spring 2022

Oberlin College

Professor Christina Neilson, Associate Professor of Art History

- **Course description:** This course investigates what it meant to make things and work with materials, including featherwork, imitation gems, color making, and metal casting, in Europe and colonial Latin America between around 1350 and 1650. We will follow historical descriptions and recipes to reconstruct methods of making, and learn from expert practitioners who are holders of traditional techniques and meanings, including indigenous makers. We will consider how a wide range of practitioners developed hands-on knowledge in workshops, laboratories, marketplaces, gardens, etc. and we will explore how making was and is a form of knowledge, how there are different systems of knowledge, and the intersections between art making and science.
- **Sample student portfolio reports:**
Similar to M&K's [Fieldnotes](https://fieldnotes.makingandknowing.org/), these portfolios document the students' hands-on activities, which included [Stucco for Molding](stucco-assignment.md), "Keeping Dry Flowers in the Same State all Year" from the bottom of [folio 120v in BnF Ms. Fr. 640](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/120v/f/120v/tl), and making and painting [cochineal lake](pigment-cochineal-lake_assignment.md) and [verdigris](verdigris-assignment.md) pigments.

Spring 2017

V&A/RCA History of Design MA

Dr. Simona Valeriani, Acting Head of History of Design, & Dr. Spike Bucklow, Director of Research, Cambridge’s Hamilton Kerr institute and the 2017 V&A’s Robert H. Smith scholar in residence.

A lab/seminar course with a series of workshops for students from the V&A/RCA History of Design MA program as a satellite of the Making and Knowing Project. The hands-on workshops included azurite paint, varnishes (including those with amber, copal, and spike lavendar oil), and imitation marbling techniques. were preceded by a series of seminars led by Dr Simona Valeriani, Acting Head of History of Design and Dr Spike Bucklow, a conservationist and colour specialist based at Cambridge’s Hamilton Kerr institute and also currently the V&A’s Robert H. Smith scholar in residence. Insights into varnish making were gained through the help of V&A conservators Dana Melchar and Nigel Bamforth.
