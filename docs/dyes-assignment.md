# Dyeing with Natural Colorants: Resources and Activity Sheets
Resources for dyeing textiles with natural colorants (including cochineal, madder, weld, and redwoods) following historical dye recipes. Recipes and procedure adapted from Jo Kirby et al, *Natural Colorants for Dyeing and Lake Pigments: Practical Recipes and their Historical Sources* (Archetype, London, 2014) (2022-06-17)

- [Presentation: Cochineal Dye: History, Chemistry, and Preparation](docs/rosenkranz_2019-april_dyes_cochineal-history-chem-prep.pdf) - an overview of historical natural colorants and dyes, details about common red colorants, a deep-dive into the history of cochineal insects as a dye and pigment source, the preparation of mordant dyes, and explanation of the chemistry of these natural colorants

- [Presentation: Dyeing: Step-by-Step Instructions](docs/rosenkranz_2018_dyes_cochineal-step-by-step.pdf) with information about sourcing materials 
- [Activity Sheet: Mordant Dyeing General Procedure](docs/rosenkranz_2019_dyes_handout_general-mordant-and-dye-processes.pdf) - procedure and instructions that can be adapted for any number of mordants and dye sources
- [Activity Sheet: Mordant Dyeing with Cochineal](docs/rosenkranz_2018_dyes_handout_dyeing-with-cochineal.pdf) - instructions for mordanting textiles with alum and dyeing with cochineal (and/or cochineal with potash as an additive)
- [Activity Sheet: Calculating ratios and amount of material needed](docs/rosenkranz_2019_dyes_handout_reconstruction-exchange_dyeing-with-natural-colorants.pdf) - created as part of a reconstruction exchange workshop with [Refashioning the Renaissance](http://refashioningrenaissance.eu/) in March 2019 on dyes (presentation above). Application of parts of the template provided below 
- [Template and recipes: natural dyes](docs/rosenkranz_2019_dyes_TEMPLATE-AND-RECIPES_dye-experiments.xlsx) - a spreadsheet pre-populated with recipes for natural colorants, information about sourcing materials, as well as templates and examples for calculating ingredient amounts based on the amount of textile to be dyed
- [Pictures: dye sample book (Naomi Rosenkranz)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/3oVnsawjQkq3JNCX7) - an incomplete sample of various dye experiments from the Making and Knowing Lab (and home kitchens!) with different combinations of textiles, natural colorants, mordants, and additives.
