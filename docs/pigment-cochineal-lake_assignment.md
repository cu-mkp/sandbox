## Lake pigments and natural colorants
If you are not already familiar with historical pigments and natural colorants, refer to [Presentation: Cochineal Lake: History, Chemistry, and Preparation](docs/rosenkranz_2021_lakes_cochineal-history-chem-prep.pdf) for more complete information and further explanation of natural colorants and lake pigments.

See also [Presentation: Introduction to Pigments &amp; Paints](docs/introduction-paints-pigments_njr_2021.pdf).

Lake pigments are a type of pigment prepared from organic natural colorants: plant and animal sources. As most organic natural colorants are soluble, they cannot be mixed
directly with a binding medium and therefore cannot be used as a pigment. These colorants must therefore be extracted and then made insoluble in order to use them as pigments.

**Lake pigments:** in general, pigments prepared from soluble natural colorants, formed by precipitating (or adsorbing) the dye onto a colorless or white, insoluble, relatively inert substrate.

## Cochineal

Cochineal is a scale insect found on prickly pear or Barbary fig cactus (Opuntia ficusindica (L.)).
Species name: Dactylopius coccus
Chemical class: carminic acid (anthraquinone)
Region: Cultivated in Mexico and Peruvian Andes, before Spain brought to Europe in 1523 where it spread rapidly.

## Historical recipe for cochineal lake

**The "Paduan Manuscript" (anonymous, Venice, late 16th-17th century)**

Mary P. Merrifield, _Medieval and Renaissance Treatises on the Arts of Painting: Original Texts with English Translations_ (1849, Dover Publications, 1969), pp. 701-702.

> _Another sort of fine lake._ Take 12 grains of powdered cochineal or fine grana, add to it 2oz of ley; leave the infusion for about 2 hours; strain it through a linen cloth and put it over hot cinders; When it boils add to it pulverized roche alum of the size of 2 peas then the ley will make a thick red scum; as soon as this happens throw it all onto a stretched linen cloth, when the clear ley will pass through leaving the coagulum on the cloth, which coagulum must afterwards be dried and made into tablets.

>_Un altra sorte di lacca fina._ - R. Piglia 12 grani di cocciniglia, o grana fina fatta inpolvere, si pone in due oncie di lissivio lasciandola in infusione due hore incirca poi si cola per pano lino, e si mette sopra cenere calda, quando vorrà bollire vi si aggiunge quanto due piselli d&#39;allume di rocca in polvere, quando il liscivo farà schiuma grossa incarnata all&#39; hora si getta tutto in un panno lino steso, e passarà il lissivo chiaro restando la schiuma nel panno, quale si fa seccare, e si fa tavolette.

## Modernized recipes, adapted for the laboratory (or kitchen)
The following recipes have been adapted from Chapter 5, "Recipes," of Jo Kirby et al, _**Natural Colorants for Dyeing and Lake Pigments: Practical Recipes and their Historical Sources**_ (Archetype, London, 2014).

There are two modernized versions of this recipe:

1. **"Standard"**
     - Extraction of cochineal in potash, precipitation of pigment with alum
2. **"Standard Reversed"**
     - Extraction of cochineal in alum, precipitation of pigment with potash

## RECIPE 1: "Standard"

### Materials and Equipment (Recipe 1)
- Mortar & pestle
- Hot plate
- Large beaker (at least 1000ml)
- Small beaker (at least 100ml)
- Pair of chopsticks or other stirring device
- Thermometer 
- Funnel
- Filter (such as a basket coffee filter) or filter paper
- pH strips
- 300ml Water - for potash (large beaker)
- 50ml Water - for alum (smaller beaker)
- Drawstring bag (such as a disposable tea bag)
- 0.24g Cochineal (the Making and Knowing Project typically sources this from Kremer Pigments, [Kremer #36040-cochineal](https://shop.kremerpigments.com/us/shop/dyes-vegetable-color-paints/natural-organic-dyes-vegetable-color-paints/36040-cochineal.html))
- 10g Alum (aluminum potassium sulfate, [Kremer #64100-potash-alum](https://shop.kremerpigments.com/us/shop/solvents-chemicals-additives/chemicals/64100-potash-alum.html))
- 4g Potash (potassium carbonate, [Kremer #64040-potash](https://shop.kremerpigments.com/us/shop/solvents-chemicals-additives/64040-potash.html))

### Procedure (Recipe 1)

- Grind cochineal in mortar and pestle
- Using a small utensil, add cochineal to the drawstring bag. Close the bag tightly
- Add potash and bag of cochineal to 300ml water in the 1000ml beaker
- Bring to a boil and boil for 15-20 min
- Using heat, dissolve 10g alum in 50 ml water in the 100ml beaker
- Warm the colored solution to about 50 ˚C and add alum solution very gradually, stirring constantly 
     - Do this slowly and incrementally, checking the pH of the solution after each addition until a pH of 6-7, there is no further effervescence, and precipitation of the lake pigment appears to be complete
- Allow the solution to settle for at least 15min (ideally overnight)
- Pour solution through filter in a funnel
- Once the liquid has drained through, wash the pigment: discard the filtrate and place funnel+filter over a clean container. Pour 100ml of clean water through the filter. Repeat until the filtrate is clear
- Allow the pigment to dry on the filter (at least overnight), then scrape off and use

## An Alternative Method To Using Hotplates and Beakers
This method uses a water bath or bain-marie (see this [cooking blog](https://www.thekitchn.com/technique-how-to-make-and-use-70190) for more information about bain-maries)

### Process

- On your stove at home, prepare your solutions in mason jars (or other glass jars that can withstand prolonged heating such as pickling or jam jars).
- Place the jars in a large cooking pot (the pot's material doesn't matter – can use steel, ceramic, etc.)
  - NOTE: be careful about using these pots to prepare foods after you have dyed with them if you are working with materials that are not food safe.
  - NOTE: the natural colorants can stain light-colored surfaces, so be careful if using ceramic or glass pots.
- Fill the pot with enough water to come up past the solutions in your mason jars, being careful not to contaminate the solutions inside your jars
- Heat the pot on your stove and follow the procedure for preparing lake pigments

**Advantages and Notes**

- This is one way to prepare pigments at home without beakers or other shock-resistant containers
- Beakers, Pyrex, and other borosilicate glass is specially formulated to withstand direct high heat (like when placed directly on a hot plate) as well as shocks or sudden changes in temperature (like placing a hot glass vessel with your bath onto a cold surface like a counter)
- Regular glass, including mason jars, are not formulated in this way, and so it can be very dangerous (and messy) if used in the same way as beakers – direct high heat or sudden change can cause the glass to shatter
- This method also allows for easier preparation without a thermometer
- The temperature of your baths is determined by the temperature of the water in the pot
- You will know the baths have approximately reached the desired temperature range of 80-100 °C when the water in the pot is beginning to simmer
- Because water boils and begins to evaporate at 100 °C, your solutions will never exceed 100 °C, the temperature at which the colorants can begin to degrade. This is an easy way to prepare solutions without a thermometer and ensure you are not reaching high temperature levels
- If the water in the pot begins to boil or simmer violently, your jars will start to shake and move around the pot. If this happens, it is a sign to turn your heat down
