# The Color Red in Ms. Fr. 640

Fall 2021, Making and Knowing in Early Modern Europe: Hands-On History

Bibliothèque nationale de France Ms. Fr. 640 is a late sixteenth-century
manuscript containing instructions, recipes, and practical notes on a
variety of subjects pertaining to crafts. As a text dealing with art
making and materials, the names of colors and pigments appear frequently
throughout. Using Carl Garris’ “What is *Azur* in Ms. Fr. 640?” and
other published essays of the digital critical edition as models, this
paper investigates words related to ‘red’ in the manuscript, both as the
color *rouge* and as red pigments and materials including lake,
vermilion, cinnabar, and rosette.[1] Although some color and pigment
words were used indiscriminately and interchangeably at the time, the
aim here is to track usages across the manuscript to see if certain
formulations appear in certain contexts. The first stage of this
research analyzes the entries in the manuscript to record the
author-practitioner’s language, and the second stage attempts to
identify patterns or meaning in use of words.

The pigments mentioned in the manuscript that produce a red color are: a
variety of lakes, including rosette, as well as minium, dragon’s blood,
vermilion, and cinnabar.[2] For the purposes of this paper I have chosen
to focus on lake and rosette (excluding minium and dragon’s blood),
vermilion, and cinnabar. I present the findings on these words in the
first section, ‘Red as Material,’ and findings related to the word
*rouge* in the second section, ‘Red as Color.’

## Red as Material

There are 2 instances of *cinabre*, or cinnabar, in the manuscript. Both
instances are of the pigment mercury(II) sulfide (α-HgS), the
naturally-occurring ore of oxidized mercury.[3] On fol. 163v the
author-practitioner writes: “a bright red color, like cinnabar,”
referring to the mineral’s characteristic bright scarlet to brick-red
color in a comparative sense.

There are 19 instances of vermilion, in 4 variations: *vermeillon*;
*vermilhon*; *vermillon*; and *vernilhon*. Every case of the word refers
to the material itself—the synthetic form of cinnabar—rather than to the
shade of red, as the word ‘vermilion’ can be used in the present day.
The author-practitioner uses the word for a comparison in one instance,
again on fol. 163v when noting that a substance acquires a “deeper
tincture” approaching vermilion.

There are 31 instances of rosette, in 7 variations: *cuivre de rosette*
(copper rosette); *fine rosette de chauldronier* (fine coppersmith’s
rosette); *rosette*; *rosette de bresil* (Brazilwood rosette); *rosette
de gand* (Ghent rosette), *rosette fine* (fine rosette); and *rosette
liquide de bresil* (liquid Brazilwood rosette). The majority of
instances appear in recipes that use the material rosette copper—a
reddish copper that when combined with tin produced an alloy called
*metal—*such as recipes on making steel mirrors, cannons, and
grenades.[4] This context suggests the material was chosen for its
properties rather than its color. However, there are three instances in
the manuscript where rosette is used as a colorant (fols. 33r, 33v, and
56v), and these correspond to it being specified as Brazilwood rosette
or Ghent rosette, referring to the bright pink pigment usually prepared
from brazilwood or sappanwood, alum and chalk.[5]

There are 46 instances of lake, in 7 variations: *lacque*; *laque*;
*laque de Florence* (Florence lake); *laque platte*; *laque platte de
Venise* (Venice *laque platte*); *laque platte dinde* (Indian *laque
platte*); and *laque ronde*. When a qualifier is specified, it either
refers to the place the pigment was supplied from, such as Florence or
Venice, or to the physical form in which the dry pigment came, such as
balls (*ronde*) or flat tablets (*platte*).[6] These specific lakes make
up 10.9% of the instances, while 89.1% are the non-specific *laque* or
*lacque*, which illustrates the ambiguous use of the word by
sixteenth-century artists and craftsmen as a red pigment. ‘Lake’ is a
name given to a range of pigments based on dyestuffs obtained from
organic sources. The word is derived from the Latin *lacca* and the
earlier Sanskrit *laksha*, used for the lac insect and the resinous
secretion it produces on its host tree, and by the sixteenth century
referred to both the raw material and the dye, and subsequently to
similar dark red pigments made from other dyes.[7] In addition to lac,
the cochineal and kermes insects, redwoods such as brazilwood and
sappanwood, and the madder plant root were used to produce red lakes.
Thus the author-practitioner could be referring to one type of lake in
all the non-specific cases, or may have felt that any lake would suffice
in those recipes. Almost all instances of the word lake in the
manuscript seem to refer to a material, however there are three
instances (7r1, 31r1, and 58r6) where it is called a color – further
textual analysis of the word ‘color’ in the manuscript might illuminate
this distinction more fully.

*Rouge* appears 199 times in the manuscript, in 36 variations: *cuivre
rouge* (red copper); *esmail rouge* (red enamel); *estain rouge* (red
tin); *goume rouge* (red gum); *mer Rouge* (Red Sea); *noir rougeastre*
(reddish black); *pavot rouge* (red poppy); *quarreau rouge* (red tile);
*rose rouge* (red rose); *rouge*; *rouge commun* (common red); *rouge
d’Allemaigne* (German red); *rouge clair*; *rouge cler*; *rouge
d’escaille*; *rouge de sanguine; rougeastre*; *rouges*; *rouges de mine*
(reds from minium); *rouget*; *rougeur*; *rougeurs*; *rougi*; *rougie*;
*rougies*; *rougir*; *rougira*; *rougiras*; *rougis*; *rougissant*;
*rougisse*; *rougissent*; *rougist*; *rougy*; *terre grasse rouge*
(fatty red earth); and *vené de rouge* (red-veined).[8] Of these, 16
variations refer to a specific material or place (34 instances; 17.1%),
while 20 are parts of speech for the noun *rouge* and verb *rougir* (165
instances; 82.9%).[9] I observed that the latter category could then be
separated based on use of the word in reference to or in the context of
heat and heating, or not – for example, on fol. 16v: “such that the
bottom is <u>red hot</u> and then you will put there the aforesaid load
of charcoals,” as opposed to on fol. 32v: “put it in dye and commonly
make it in three <u>colors</u>, green, <u>red</u>, and sometimes
violet.”[10] I identified 128 (77.6%) of these as related to heat, and
37 (22.4%) not. This reveals that the vast majority of usages of the
word red are to describe redness as produced by heat, which accords with
the high number of recipes in the manuscript on molding and casting that
require heating materials to a high temperature.

## Conclusion

Upon investigation of the color red in Ms. Fr. 640, it is difficult to
reach a firm conclusion at this stage about the author-practitioner’s
intentions in his choice of certain words. With the materials vermilion,
cinnabar, and rosette, the usage is relatively straightforward,
referring to the pigment and in some cases that from a specific source,
however it becomes more complicated to discern usage patterns of red as
a color with lake and *rouge/rougir*. Variations of rouge are used most
frequently in a context of heating, as something is red or reddened by
heat.

Further analysis of the color red and of these data sets could include
looking at the instances of name-specificity (either place or form) and
attempting to determine why the author-practitioner indicated that in
certain recipes. A related avenue of textual analysis would be to
quantify the instances of other colors such as blue, green, yellow,
black, and white to see how the frequency compares to red (especially
with the high usage of the word in the descriptive context of red-hot).

for a table with names for red lake pigments. Lakes were manufactured by
precipitating or adsorbing a dye onto a substrate; the most common
reagent to form a substrate was potash alum, potassium aluminum sulfate,
AlK(SO4)2·12H2O. The main characteristic of lakes is their translucency,
which made them ideal pigments for use in oil paint to depict faint
coloring in a face or depth and shadow in drapery when built up over
opaque pigments.

[10] I acknowledge that this is subjective, as the designation was
sometimes difficult to determine and certain instances could be argued
to fit into both categories.
