Adapted from chapter 5, “Recipes,” of Jo Kirby et al, *Natural Colorants
for Dyeing and Lake Pigments: Practical Recipes and their Historical
Sources* (Archetype, London, 2014).

### MATERIALS 

-   Dyestuff (cochineal)

-   mordant (alum)

-   Mortar and pestle

-   Coffee filter

-   Water

-   Textile - 25 g cotton bandana

-   Thermometer

-   Stirring stick

-   Plate

#### Ratios of Materials

Textile (weight of fiber - WOF) : mordant (alum) : water

1g : 0.2g : 50g

Textile : cochineal : water

1 : 1.25g : 62.5g

### PROCEDURE

#### Mordant bath

-   Measure out water into pot

-   Add alum and stir

-   Place beaker onto hot plate and turn on to medium-low

-   Stir to dissolve alum in the water

-   Pre-wet textiles with water and wring them out to remove water

-   Add textiles when alum solution reaches 70º C

-   Heat the textiles for 20 minutes at 80-90º C, stirring occasionally to ensure homogenous absorption

-   Remove textiles, then rinse them thoroughly in cold water

#### Extract Dye From Cochineal

-   Using mortar and pestle, crush dyestuffs to a fine powder or into small pieces

-   Measure out water and pour into pot

-   Add dyestuffs to drawstring bag, close tightly, add bag to water

-   Place pot on stove, at medium-low

-   Heat the bath (without the textiles) at 80-90 °C for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally

-   After 30 minutes, remove dyestuffs in drawstring bag

#### Dye Textiles

-   Add textiles to the dye bath (it is usually best to pre-wet textiles with water before adding)

-   Heat textiles at 80-90 °C for 20 min, stirring occasionally to ensure homogeneous dyeing

-   After 20 minutes, remove the textiles from the bath

-   Being careful not to damage (or, if using wool, to felt the textile), wash textiles with clean water to remove any dye that has not bound to them

-   When the water runs clear over the textiles and no color comes off the textiles, wring out excess water

-   Lay out the textiles to dry

## Reflection

On a separate piece of paper, write a paragraph about the experience
using one of the guiding questions below:

-   *How can we connect art, science, and nature through sustainable practices?*

-   *What is the value in reconstructing historical procedures?*

-   *What is the importance of understanding where materials come from?*

-   *What went differently than expected? How did you react to these situations?*
