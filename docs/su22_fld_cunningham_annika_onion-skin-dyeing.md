## First round - 07/07/22 - prepping the onion skins and using alum as a mordant
- Based off the recipes I found, there was no consistent ratio between onion skins to amount of textile to water
  - Websites I looked at: 
    - [https://crafternoontreats.com/2018/06/12/natural-dyeing-with-onion-skins/](https://crafternoontreats.com/2018/06/12/natural-dyeing-with-onion-skins/)
    - [https://caitlynirwin.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-dyeing-with-onion-skins](https://caitlynirwin.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-dyeing-with-onion-skins)
    - [https://allnaturaldyeing.com/onion-skin-dye/](https://allnaturaldyeing.com/onion-skin-dye/)
- I used 7.5 grams of textile and the onion skins from 5 yellow onions (they were very hard to weigh; my scale was not sensitive enough to give me a number so I'm guessing it was 2 grams or less)
  - This was a lot less onion skins than the websites I was looking at used, but it worked well. In the future I want to try different ratios and see how it affects the color, but you need a LOT of onions for that.
  - Additionally, I want to try using red onions to see if/how that changes the color
- I ended up heating the onion and water for 1hr and 20 minutes, but again there was no magic number for how long to heat the onions so I think anything over an hour would work

- I also prepared my mordant, alum, just using the information from the sandbox, I used the standard ratios and followed the general mordant and dye process

- I only used a mordant for half of my textiles, while the alum definitely gave the textiles (a wool sample and a cotton blend sample) a bunch brighter and vibrant orange/yellow color, the textiles without mordant picked up color well, leaving a pale brown/yellow

- In total I had about 150 mL of the onion skin dye bath, even with a small amount, it dyes the textiles well
- Overall this was a very successful attempt at dying, there are definitely things I want to keep exploring, but all things considered it worked very well. One thing that's great about the onions is that there is a lot of forgiveness throughout the process. The vague and very different ratios and processes I was reading about were a little confusing at first, but I think ultimately show precision is not a necessary component for this process, which makes it a perfect starting point for people who want to try natural dyes

## Second round - 07/12/22 - adding iron and copper
- Unfortunately, I did not have enough onions to make a new dye bath, so I created a mordant bath for the iron and copper and put the textiles I had already dyed in them
- I used the ratios from the [DYE AND MORDANT RECIPES](rosenkranz_2019_dyes_handout_reconstruction-exchange_dyeing-with-natural-colorants.pdf)  document for ratios
- I had two baths, iron and copper, but four different bundles - iron, iron + alum, copper, copper + alum
- Pretty straightforward, I just followed the standard mordant bath recipe as described above and put my textiles in

- In some of the websites, they were able to achieve lighter and more vibrant greens, so I want to try different ratios, especially with the iron sulfate to get a bigger range of green values.
- The copper sulfate made the textiles without alum and the textiles with alum basically the same color, I wonder if this is because they were in the same beaker or if copper had the same effect on the onion dye regardless of the alum
