# Activity: Reconstruction of a 16th-century Burn Salve Recipe

This medical remedy to treat burns appears in BnF Ms. Fr. 640, a late sixteenth-century manuscript of artisanal recipes compiled by an anonymous author-practitioner working in Toulouse, France. 

In a laboratory at Columbia University, the Making and Knowing Project has reconstructed the burn salve by following the instructions provided by the Renaissance author-practitioner. The result is a smooth and creamy ointment that would not seem out of place in your home's medicine cabinet!
