# Activity: Reconstruction of a 16th-century Burn Salve Recipe



This medical remedy to treat burns appears in BnF Ms. Fr. 640, a late sixteenth-century manuscript of artisanal recipes compiled by an anonymous author-practitioner working in Toulouse, France. 

**Against burns, excellent ([fol. 103r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/103r/tc/103r/tl))**
*Heat linseed oil on a gentle fire without letting it boil & simmer, but once it is hot, put in a quarter as much of the newest wax you can. Once melted, let it cool, & once they begin to curdle, stir continuously with a new wooden spatula for as long as it takes you to say 9 paternoster, and as you say them, wash this composition with holy water, stirring all the while. Having said the first 9 paternoster, pour out the first water & put in new one, & wash & stir the composition for the time it takes you to say 8 paternoster, and the 3rd time for as long as 7, & thus you will consecutively add new water, doing the same as above, until the last & single paternoster of nine. Then you shall have a soft & white ointment, with which you shall anoint the burn for the space of 9 days. But do not apply it any longer than this, for it would cause your flesh to grow excessively. You shall bandage yourself twice a day, & each time you shall wash your face with water & wine mixed together, a little tepid, not rubbing, but as if pressing with a wet linen cloth, and you shall wipe it similarly with a fine linen cloth, & next put the ointment, over which you can put ivy leaves. This causes hair to regrow & leaves no scar. A gunpowder maker who had almost completely burnt himself & showed no sign of the burn, taught me this.*

## Reconstructing the Burn Salve

In a laboratory at Columbia University, the Making and Knowing Project has reconstructed the burn salve by following the instructions provided on [fol. 103r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/103r/tc/103r/tl). The result is a smooth and creamy ointment that would not seem out of place in your home's medicine cabinet!

This recipe is fully explored by Xiaomeng Liu's essay, [An Excellent Salve for Burns](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/essays/ann_080_sp_17), which notes the juxtaposition of the complex, transformative process described with the relatively few ingredients needed. The essay also highlights the ways in which this recipe is unusual among the other medical recipes in Ms. Fr. 640: it possesses explicit spiritual dimensions (pure ingredients, holy water, and the recitation of prayers) and it provides information about its source and trustworthiness.
