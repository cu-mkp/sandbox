# The Making and Knowing Project *Sandbox*
**Site and Projects Under Development**

The “Sandbox” makes available a number of resources that utilize and explore the data underlying [_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France. A Digital Critical Edition and English Translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/) created by the [Making and Knowing Project](https://www.makingandknowing.org/) at Columbia University.

The Sandbox presents experimental, provisional, and in-progress work that expands upon the engagement and analyses with the data, topics, and content of _Secrets of Craft and Nature_, with the manuscript, BnF Ms. Fr. 640, and the larger themes explored by the Making and Knowing Project.

The Making and Knowing Project hopes to create an online environment for students, scholars, and others to explore and experiment with the Project’s data using a variety of digital tools, where others can add and create their own tools, case studies, and resources presented here. This is also a space for sharing teaching resources, exploring methods and processes across disciplines and levels of expertise, and engaging in knowledge exchange wherever possible.

## [Digital Projects](docs/index-digital-projects.md)
Projects showcasing textual analysis, data visualization, explorations of M&K's encoding of Fr. 640, and methods for using Fr. 640 as data.

## [Edition Prototypes](docs/index-edition-prototypes.md)
In the development of _Secrets of Craft and Nature_, a number of iterations, mockups, wireframes, and prototype editions were created and deployed.

## [M&K Student Projects](docs/index-course-projects.md)
From 2019 onwards, M&K's courses at Columbia University have asked students to create exploratory final projects. These have included:

**ENGL84031 / HISTGU4031 / COMS4495: *Transforming Texts* (Spring 2019)**

The Spring 2019 course *Transforming Texts: Textual Analysis, Literary Modeling, and Visualization* built upon M&K's previous Digital and Lab Seminars. Geared towards students from the humanities and computer science, the course encouraged the disciplines to work together to analyze, explore, and understand historical texts.

**GU4962: *Hands-on History* (2021- )**

The Final Project in the undergraduate/graduate lab seminar *Making and Knowing in Early Modern Europe: Hands-on History* are intended to serve as companion pieces to the Digital Critical Edition, *Secrets of Craft and Nature*, or form a part of the Making and Knowing Project’s Research and Teaching Companion to *Secrets of Craft and Nature*. These exploratory and experimental projects are meant to help brainstorm, design, and implement alternative paths by which to access the material in the Edition and/or provide other forms of disseminating and engaging with the themes.
