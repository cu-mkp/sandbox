# The Making and Knowing Project *Sandbox*
**Site and Projects Under Development**

The “Sandbox” makes available a number of resources that utilize and explore the data underlying [_Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France. A Digital Critical Edition and English Translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/) created by the [Making and Knowing Project](https://www.makingandknowing.org/) at Columbia University.

The Sandbox presents experimental, provisional, and in-progress work that expands upon the engagement and analyses with the data, topics, and content of _Secrets of Craft and Nature_ and with the manuscript, BnF Ms. Fr. 640.

The Making and Knowing Project hopes to create an online environment for students, scholars, and others to explore and experiment with the Project’s data using a variety of digital tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks), where others can add and create their own tools, case studies, and resources presented here.

## Summer 2021 Final Projects for the course GU4692: *Hands on History* (2021-07-08)
The Final Project in the undergraduate/graduate lab seminar *Making and Knowing in Early Modern Europe: Hands-on History* [[SU21 Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTdDTbjg3Wo-03RCA7KtszFF-nVyY0ECotExiQK8SnNpBQ_zNC0tBv9f_RUCujxGlTkdFTZiGicbVKO/pub)] are intended to serve as companion pieces to the Digital Critical Edition, *Secrets of Craft and Nature*, or form a part of the Making and Knowing Project’s Research and Teaching Companion to *Secrets of Craft and Nature*. These exploratory and experimental projects are meant to help brainstorm, design, and implement alternative paths by which to access the material in the Edition and/or provide other forms of disseminating and engaging with the themes. Unlike print publications, open access digital publications do not have an institutional framework by which they are discovered and disseminated. It is thus important to come up with alternative paths by which the digital edition can be accessed, discovered, disseminated, and, ultimately, made sustainable through a community of users.
